# Blocks Puzzle Solver
## Design and Data Structure ##
* This Sliding Block Puzzle primarily consists of 3 main classes: **Board**, **Block** and **Sovler**. Each class keeping track of variables that are neccessary to solve the puzzle or traverse back to the initial configuration after the puzzle is solved.

* The **Board** class consists of several crucial data structures that were chosen carefully to optimize the run time of this program. It is also the class that initialize a block using the given data in initial configuration file. The *hashCode* method of this class is also overriden to avoid clustering in HashSet implemented in **Solver** class. Below are the data structures contained in **Board** class:
  * `board`: A 2D Array boolean matrix which is used to store which coordinates are occupied or unoccupied by a **Block** instance at any given moment. This data structure was chosen because it has constant lookup time given a pair of index. The constructor of the Board class initialize this Array to the given size in the first line of initial configuration file. 
  * `blocks`: A HashSet of **Block** instances placed on the **Board**. The *hashCode* method for **Block** was overriden in order to achieve constant lookup and insert time for `blocks` HashSet.
  * `parent`: A **Board** instance used to traverse back to the original configuration after a solution is found.
  * `move`: A string containing 4 integers saying which move was taken to reach the current board.
  * `rank`: A double used in PriorityQueue. The value of the `rank` is calculated using the distance between each similar block (same width and height) in current board and block in final configuration baord.

* The **Block** class is considerably more simple than the other 2 classes. It consists of mainly 2 built-in **Point** instances called `topLeft` and `btmRight`. These 2 variables store the coordinate of the upper left corner and lower right corner of a block. The `x` and `y` variables in the **Point** object correspond to the row and the column of the corner (opposite of how coordinate is defiend on Cartesian Plane). This class also consists of several getter functions that return point object or the width and height of the block. 4 of the methods inherited from **Object** class are also overriden. The *hashCode* method is overriden to avoid clustering in the **Block** hashSet initialized in **Board** class. The *equals* method is overriden so that 2 blocks having same `topLeft` and `btmRight` coordinates are consider the same.

* The **Solver** class is the heart of this Sliding Puzzle Solver program. It consists of *solve* method where heuristic greedy search algorithm is implemented. Below are the data structures contained in **Solver** class.
  * `visited`: A HashSet of **Board** instances already visited by the solving algorithm. The *hashCode* method in Board class was overidden in order to achive constant lookup and insert time which is crucial to meet the time constraints. 
  * `boardQueue`: A PriorityQueue of Board that stores all board configuration after proceeding all possible moves for a given board.
